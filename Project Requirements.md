Project Description 

The library will have a public-facing blog that will serve to communicate library news, events and resources, as well as providing the library’s user community with the ability to comment on posts. 

Service Need 

The University of Awesomeness Library has a need for communicating changes to policies, procedures, and resources to its users. Library blogs have been shown to be an effective method of communicating with library users. 1 We currently have a home-grown blog in place, but it lacks many of the functionalities we require. 

Project Purpose & Scope 

The purpose of this project is to provide library users with a forum for learning about and commenting on library news, events and resources through an official University of Awesomeness Library Blog. 

Technical Challenges / Issues 

The library is currently aware of several blog systems used by other institutions. Native mobile support on those systems seems to be lacking. Our current system has been in place since 2008and no longer meets our users’ needs. The current system also has issues with the IE browser. 1 Diane L. Schrecker, (2008)
